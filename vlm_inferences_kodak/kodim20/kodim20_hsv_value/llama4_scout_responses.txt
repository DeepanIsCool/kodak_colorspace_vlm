QUESTION Q4:
How would you describe the color quality and lighting in this image?

ANSWER:
The image is a black-and-white photograph of an airplane on a grassy field. The color quality is, therefore, grayscale, with no visible colors present.

The lighting in the image appears to be natural daylight, likely from the sun. The sky in the background is overexposed and appears white, suggesting that the sun may be shining brightly. The shadows cast by the plane and other objects in the scene are not particularly prominent, indicating that the light is fairly even and diffused. Overall, the lighting is well-balanced and helps to bring out the details of the plane and its surroundings.

QUESTION Q5:
What are the three most dominant colors in this image, and where do they appear?

ANSWER:
The three most dominant colors in this image are:

1. **Light Gray**: This color appears on the body of the airplane, which is the main subject of the image. It covers a significant portion of the plane's surface.
2. **Dark Gray**: This color is used for the stripes on the wing and tail of the airplane, as well as on the propeller. It provides a striking contrast to the light gray body of the plane.
3. **White**: This color appears on the background of the image, which is a bright sky. It also appears on the grassy field where the airplane is parked, although to a lesser extent. Additionally, there are some white accents on the plane itself, such as the tip of the propeller and some decals.
