What are the main colors of the objects in this image? Be specific about color names.

ANSWER:
The image is too dark to discern any colors. The building appears to be made of dark-colored stone or brick, but the exact shade is indistinguishable due to the low lighting. The windows and door are also difficult to make out, but they seem to have white or light-colored frames.
