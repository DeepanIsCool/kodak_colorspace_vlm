The color quality is grayscale, with no visible colors present.\n\nThe lighting in the image appears to be natural daylight, likely during the daytime. The overall illumination is fairly even, with no harsh shadows or overly bright highlights. The light seems to be coming from the front of the building, casting subtle shadows on the stone walls and around the windows and door. There are no strong contrasts or dramatic lighting effects, resulting in a relatively flat and neutral lighting style that suits the monochromatic color scheme."
