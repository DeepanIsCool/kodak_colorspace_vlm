QUESTION Q3:
For each object you see, what color is it? List objects and their colors.

ANSWER:
The image provided appears to be a black-and-white photograph of a building's facade. Given that it's in black and white, the colors of the objects are limited to various shades of gray. Here is a list of objects and their corresponding shades of gray:
