3. **Light Gray**: The lightest areas of the image are light gray, which can be seen in the highlights on the grass and other surfaces.

These three shades are the most dominant in the image, with black being the most prevalent, followed by dark gray, and then light gray.

In terms of where they appear, the black shades are primarily found in the shadows, while the dark gray shades are visible in the mid-tones, and the light gray shades are present in the highlights.

Therefore, the three most dominant shades in the image are black, dark gray, and light gray, which appear in the shadows, mid-tones, and highlights, respectively.
