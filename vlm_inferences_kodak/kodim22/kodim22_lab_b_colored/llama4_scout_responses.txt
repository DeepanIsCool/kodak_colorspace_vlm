QUESTION Q3:
For each object you see, what color is it? List objects and their colors.

ANSWER:
The image provided appears to be a landscape scene with a house and trees reflected in water. However, the entire image is tinted a uniform yellow-green color, making it difficult to discern specific details or colors of individual objects.

Given the uniform tint, it's not possible to accurately list objects and their specific colors as the image does not provide enough contrast or detail to distinguish between different colors. The dominant color observed is a shade of yellow-green.

However, based on the description and general knowledge of common objects and their typical colors:

1. **House** - Typically, houses can be various colors, but in this image, it appears yellow-green.
2. **Trees** - Usually green, but here they appear yellow-green.
3. **Water** - Normally, water can range from blue to reflect the sky and surroundings; in this case, it seems to blend with the yellow-green tint.
4. **Sky** - Usually blue, but it's tinted similarly to the rest of the image, yellow-green.

In conclusion, due to the monochromatic yellow-green tint of the image, all identifiable objects appear to be this color. 

- House: Yellow-green
- Trees: Yellow-green
- Water: Yellow-green
- Sky: Yellow-green

This list might not accurately represent the real colors of these objects but reflects their appearance in the provided image.
