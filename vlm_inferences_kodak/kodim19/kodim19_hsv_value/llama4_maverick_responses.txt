QUESTION Q1:
What do you see in this image? Describe the scene in detail.

ANSWER:
The image is a black-and-white photograph of a lighthouse and its surrounding buildings. The lighthouse is white with a black railing around the top, and it has a small window on the side. It is surrounded by a white picket fence, which encloses a small yard with grass and a few rocks. To the left of the lighthouse is a small building with a gable roof, also enclosed by the white picket fence. In front of the lighthouse, on the right side of the image, is a coin-operated binocular viewer on a stand. The background of the image is a cloudy sky.
