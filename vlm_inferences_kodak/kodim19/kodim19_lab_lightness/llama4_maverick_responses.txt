To the left of the lighthouse is a small building with a gable roof, also enclosed by the white picket fence. In front of the lighthouse, on the right side of the image, is a coin-operated binocular viewer on a stand. The sky above is cloudy, and there are trees visible in the distance behind the lighthouse. The overall atmosphere suggests a daytime setting, possibly during the summer or spring season.
