QUESTION Q4:
How would you describe the color quality and lighting in this image?

ANSWER:
The image is presented in black and white, which inherently limits the color quality to shades of gray. The lighting appears to be natural daylight with some clouds in the sky, suggesting that it might be overcast. The overall effect of the lighting is soft and even, with no harsh shadows or overly bright highlights, which is typical for an overcast day. The lack of vibrant colors means that the focus is on the textures and contrasts between different shades of gray, adding depth and interest to the scene.
