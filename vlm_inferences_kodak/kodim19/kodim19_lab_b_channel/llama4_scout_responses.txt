QUESTION Q2:
What are the main colors of the objects in this image? Be specific about color names.

ANSWER:
The image provided appears to be a grayscale image, which means it does not contain any colors in the classical sense but rather various shades of gray. However, if we are to interpret the question as asking for the main shades or tones present in the image, here is an analysis:

The main tones of the objects in this image are various shades of gray, ranging from very light to very dark. 

- The lighthouse and the house appear to be light gray.
- The sky is a darker shade of gray with some areas appearing almost black due to the clouds.

Since the image is grayscale, there are no specific color names like red, blue, or green. The description is limited to shades of gray.
