QUESTION Q4:
How would you describe the color quality and lighting in this image?

ANSWER:
The image is presented in black and white, which affects the color quality by eliminating any vibrant colors and presenting the scene in shades of gray. The lighting appears to be natural, likely from the sun, as indicated by the shadows cast on the wall and the hats. The shadows are long and diagonal, suggesting that the sun is low in the sky. The overall effect is a moody and atmospheric image with high contrast between light and dark areas.

ANSWER:
The three most dominant colors in this image are:

2. **Dark Gray**: This color appears on the brims and crowns of the hats, providing a clear contrast to the lighter shades.
3. **White**: White is used for the text on the hats ("Bahamas") and is also visible in the sky and clouds in the background, adding a touch of brightness to the image.

These colors are distributed throughout the image, with the light gray and dark gray dominating the foreground and the white accents adding visual interest.
