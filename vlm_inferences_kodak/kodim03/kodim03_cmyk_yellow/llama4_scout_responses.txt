The lighting in the image appears to be low-key, with deep shadows and highlights that accentuate the textures of the caps and their display.

QUESTION Q5:
What are the three most dominant colors in this image, and where do they appear?

ANSWER:
The three most dominant colors in this image are:

1. **Black**: The background of the image is predominantly black, which appears in the upper half of the image and on the right side.
2. **Gray**: The middle section of the image features a gray tone, which is present on the hats and the surface they are placed on.
3. **White**: The white color is prominent on the hats themselves, which have "Bahamas" written on them in cursive. The hats are placed on a transparent or semi-transparent material that allows the gray tone to show through.

These colors appear throughout the image, with black dominating the background, gray covering the middle section, and white prominent on the hats.
