QUESTION Q5:
What are the three most dominant colors in this image, and where do they appear?

ANSWER:
The three most dominant colors in this image are:

1. **Black**: This color appears in the shadows of the objects and the lower parts of the image, creating a sense of depth and dimensionality.
2. **Gray**: Gray is the dominant color in the sky and clouds, covering a significant portion of the top half of the image. It also appears in various shades on the objects, adding texture and nuance to the scene.
3. **Dark Gray**: A darker shade of gray is present in the mid-tones of the image, particularly in the areas where the objects are partially shaded. This color helps to create a sense of volume and structure.

These colors work together to create a moody and atmospheric image with a focus on shading and texture.
