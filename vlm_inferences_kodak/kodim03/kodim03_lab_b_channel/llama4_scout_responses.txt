QUESTION Q2:
What are the main colors of the objects in this image? Be specific about color names.

QUESTION Q4:
How would you describe the color quality and lighting in this image?

ANSWER:
The image is a grayscale photograph of four white baseball caps with the word "Bahamas" embroidered on them. The caps are arranged in a row, with the first cap positioned at an angle and the others following suit.

**Color Quality:**
The color quality of the image is grayscale, meaning it only features shades of gray, ranging from light to dark. There are no vibrant colors present in the image.

**Lighting:**
The lighting in the image appears to be natural, likely coming from the sun. The shadows cast by the caps suggest that the light source is positioned above and to the left of the caps. The overall effect of the lighting is soft and diffused, which helps to create a sense of depth and dimensionality in the image. 

The lighting also creates a sense of atmosphere, giving the impression that the photo was taken outdoors on a cloudy day or in a shaded area.

QUESTION Q5:
What are the three most dominant colors in this image, and where do they appear?

ANSWER:
The three most dominant colors in this image are:

1. **White**: The primary color of the hats and appears on the front of the image.
2. **Gray**: The secondary color that makes up the background and shadows of the image.
3. **Black**: The color of the text on the hats, which is used to write "Bahamas".

These colors appear throughout the image, with white being the most prominent on the hats, gray dominating the background, and black used for the text.
