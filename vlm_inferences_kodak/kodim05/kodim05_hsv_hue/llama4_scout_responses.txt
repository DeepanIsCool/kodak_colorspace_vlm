The three most dominant colors in this image are:

*   **Gray**: The second most dominant color, appearing as splotches and patches throughout the image. These gray areas seem to be overlapping the bicycles and the background, giving the image a sense of distortion or degradation.
*   **White**: The third most dominant color, appearing as small, scattered spots and edges around the gray splotches. These white areas add a sense of contrast and texture to the image.

These colors appear throughout the image, with black being the most prominent, followed by gray, and then white. The bicycles are positioned in the center of the image, with their wheels and frames visible despite the distorted color overlay.
