QUESTION Q5:
What are the three most dominant colors in this image, and where do they appear?

ANSWER:
The image is a grayscale image, which means it only contains shades of gray. However, if we were to analyze the dominant colors in terms of their lightness and darkness, here are the three most dominant "colors" (shades of gray) and where they appear:

1. **Light Gray**: This is the dominant shade, appearing in the hat, the woman's face, and the clothing.
2. **Medium Gray**: This shade appears in the background, behind the woman's head and hat.
3. **Dark Gray**: This shade appears in the shadows of the woman's face, particularly around her eyes, nose, and mouth, as well as in the background, adding depth to the image.

Keep in mind that these are not colors in the classical sense, but rather shades of gray that make up the grayscale image.
