QUESTION Q5:
What are the three most dominant colors in this image, and where do they appear?

ANSWER:
The image is a black-and-white photograph, so there are no colors present. The dominant shades in the image are various tones of gray and black, which appear throughout the scene. The lighthouse, buildings, rocks, and water are all depicted in different shades of gray, ranging from very dark to lighter tones. The sky above is also a mix of grays, with some areas appearing more cloudy or textured than others.

Since the image is monochrome, it's not possible to identify three distinct colors. However, if we were to analyze the tonal range, we could say that the dominant shades are:

1. Deep blacks: These appear in the silhouettes of the lighthouse, buildings, and rocks.
2. Dark grays: These are visible in the shadows and darker areas of the image, such as the lower parts of the lighthouse and the surrounding landscape.
3. Mid-tones: These are present in the sky, the water, and some of the textures on the rocks and buildings.

These shades work together to create a moody and atmospheric image that captures the essence of a nighttime scene by the sea.
