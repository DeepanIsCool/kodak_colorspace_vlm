The lighthouse is surrounded by several buildings, including what appears to be a keeper's house or other outbuildings. The buildings are dark and featureless, with no visible windows or doors. In the foreground, there are large rocks and boulders scattered along the shoreline. The sky above is overcast, with a few clouds visible.
