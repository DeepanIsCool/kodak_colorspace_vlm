QUESTION Q5:
What are the three most dominant colors in this image, and where do they appear?

ANSWER:
The image is a low-resolution, monochromatic representation of a lighthouse scene, with a dominant yellow-green hue. The three most prominent colors in the image are:

1. **Yellow-Green (#C7F464 or similar shade)**: This color is uniformly applied across the entire image, giving it a distinctive tone. It appears everywhere, from the sky and clouds to the buildings, lighthouse, and landscape.

2. **Blue-Gray (#6A5ACD or similar shade)**: Although not as vibrant due to the overlay, the original image likely contained various shades of blue for the sky and possibly the sea or shadows. The blue-gray tone is subtly visible beneath the yellow-green overlay, particularly in the sky and water areas.

3. **Dark Gray or Black**: While not immediately apparent due to the yellow-green filter, darker shades that could be interpreted as dark gray or black are present in the outlines and details of the structures and possibly in shadowed areas. These are more about the contrast and texture than a distinct color.

**Locations of the Colors:**

- **Yellow-Green**: Dominates the entire scene, covering the sky, buildings, lighthouse, and the landscape.
- **Blue-Gray**: Visible in the background, particularly in the sky and possibly the water, though its presence is muted by the yellow-green overlay.
- **Dark Gray or Black**: Found in the outlines and details of the buildings and lighthouse, contributing to the texture and depth of the image.

In summary, while the image is predominantly yellow-green, the underlying colors suggest a scene that originally included blues for the sky and possibly water, with darker tones for shadows and details.
