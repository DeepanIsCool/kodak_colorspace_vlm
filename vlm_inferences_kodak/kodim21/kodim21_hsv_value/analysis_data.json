        "question": "What do you see in this image? Describe the scene in detail.",
        "answer": "The image is a black-and-white photograph of a lighthouse on a rocky coastline. The lighthouse is white with a dark band around the top and a small balcony around the light at the very top. It stands tall on a rocky outcrop, surrounded by large rocks and boulders. \n\nTo the left of the lighthouse are several buildings, including what appears to be a house or keeper's quarters, with a steeply pitched roof and multiple windows. A white fence runs along the edge of the cliff, separating the buildings from the rocky shoreline.\n\nIn the foreground, waves crash against the rocks, creating white foam. The sky above is cloudy, but the sun appears to be shining down on the scene, casting a warm glow over everything. In the distance, there is a body of water that stretches out to the horizon, where it meets the sky. \n\nOverall, the image presents a serene and picturesque scene, capturing the beauty of a rugged coastline and the historic charm of a lighthouse."
