QUESTION Q4:
How would you describe the color quality and lighting in this image?

ANSWER:
The image presents a grayscale scene of a lighthouse situated on a rocky coastline, accompanied by two buildings. The dominant color quality is a range of grays, from light to dark, which creates a somber and moody atmosphere.

**Color Quality:**

*   The shades of gray vary, creating depth and contrast in the image.
*   The lack of color emphasizes the textures and tones of the scene.

**Lighting:**

*   The lighting in the image is primarily due to the presence of the lighthouse, which appears to be emitting light from its top.
*   However, the light from the lighthouse is not directly visible in the image, as it seems to be turned off or not shining towards the viewer.
*   The darkness of the sky and the shadows on the rocks suggest that the scene is set at night or in low-light conditions.
