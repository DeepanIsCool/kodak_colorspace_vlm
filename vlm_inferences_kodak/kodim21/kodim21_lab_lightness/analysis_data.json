The lighthouse, positioned centrally, features a white base that gradually tapers as it ascends, culminating in a dark-colored top. A small balcony encircles the top section.\n\nTo the left of the lighthouse stands a substantial house with a steeply pitched roof, accompanied by two smaller buildings behind it. A white fence runs along the edge of the cliff, providing a sense of depth and perspective to the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, large rocks are visible, with waves crashing against them, creating a dynamic contrast between the stillness of the structures and the movement of the sea. The background showcases a vast expanse of water, with hills or mountains visible on the horizon. The sky above is dotted with clouds, adding texture and atmosphere to the overall composition. The image exudes a sense of tranquility and timelessness, inviting the viewer to appreciate its beauty."
