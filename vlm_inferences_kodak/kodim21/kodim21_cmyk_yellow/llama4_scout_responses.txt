QUESTION Q1:
What do you see in this image? Describe the scene in detail.

ANSWER:
The image presents a grayscale model of a lighthouse situated on a rocky cliffside, accompanied by several buildings. The lighthouse, positioned centrally, features a tall, slender tower with a lantern room at the top and a small balcony surrounding it. A short staircase leads to the entrance.

To the left of the lighthouse stands a large house with a steeply pitched roof and multiple chimneys, while a smaller building is located to its right. In front of these structures, a low wall runs along the edge of the cliff, which appears to be made of rough-hewn stone or rock. The background of the image is dark, suggesting that it was taken at night or in low-light conditions. Overall, the scene exudes a sense of serenity and tranquility, with the lighthouse standing sentinel over the rocky coastline.
