QUESTION Q1:
What do you see in this image? Describe the scene in detail.

ANSWER:
The image is a black-and-white photograph of a lighthouse on a rocky coastline. The lighthouse is the central focus of the image, with a large house to its left and a smaller building to its right. The lighthouse is tall and cylindrical, with a dark base that tapers to a white top. It has a railing around the top and a light at the very top. The house to the left is two stories, with a gable roof and a chimney. It appears to be a residential building, possibly the home of the lighthouse keeper. The smaller building to the right of the lighthouse is likely a storage shed or other outbuilding. In the foreground, the rocky coastline is visible, with waves crashing against the shore. The sky above is cloudy and overcast, adding to the dramatic atmosphere of the image. Overall, the image conveys a sense of isolation and ruggedness, with the lighthouse standing sentinel over the rocky coastline.
