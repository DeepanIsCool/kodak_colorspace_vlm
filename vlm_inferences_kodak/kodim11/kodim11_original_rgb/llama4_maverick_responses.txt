    *   The pier's supports are rusted and corroded, with some sections missing or broken.
    *   The concrete surface of the pier is cracked and worn, with debris scattered about.
*   The water surrounding the pier and sailboat is a vibrant turquoise color, with a few ripples disturbing the otherwise calm surface.
    *   The water is clear, allowing the viewer to see the rocky bottom beneath the surface.
    *   A few pieces of debris, such as seaweed or trash, are visible floating on the surface of the water.
