QUESTION Q5:
What are the three most dominant colors in this image, and where do they appear?

ANSWER:
The image is a black-and-white illustration, so it does not have any colors. The dominant shades are various tones of gray and black.

However, if we were to interpret the question as asking about the most prominent shades or tones in the image, we could say that:

*   The darkest shade (black) is used for the figure of the grim reaper and other objects in the foreground.
*   The middle shade (dark gray) is used for the background and some details on the grim reaper's clothing.
*   The lightest shade (light gray) is used for highlights on the background.

These three shades are the most dominant in the image, with black being the most prominent due to its use for the main subject, the grim reaper.
