QUESTION Q5:
What are the three most dominant colors in this image, and where do they appear?

ANSWER:
The three most dominant colors in this image are:

*   **Dark Gray**: The woman's dress and the metal sculpture behind her are primarily dark gray. The dress is a long, flowing garment that covers most of her body, while the sculpture is a large, abstract piece that appears to be made of metal.
*   **Light Gray**: The pearls around the woman's neck are light gray. They are layered and add a touch of elegance to her outfit.
*   **Black**: The shadows and some of the details in the background, such as the trees and bushes, are black. These dark areas help to create depth and contrast in the image.

These colors appear throughout the image, with the dark gray and black tones dominating the background and the light gray pearls adding a pop of contrast.
