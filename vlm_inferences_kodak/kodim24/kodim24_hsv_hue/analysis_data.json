It appears in the background, on the roof, and in various parts of the house's facade.\n\n2. **Gray**: Gray tones are prevalent across the entire image, contributing to its monochromatic appearance. It is visible on the house's walls, windows, and balcony, giving the scene a uniform yet nuanced texture.\n\n3. **White**: White is present but less dominant, primarily appearing in the highlights and possibly in some details or reflections within the image. However, due to the overall dark and grayscale nature of the image, white's presence is more subtle, often seen as lighter shades of gray rather than pure white. It appears in the windows and possibly in the chimney and some architectural details."
