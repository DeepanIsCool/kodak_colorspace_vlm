QUESTION Q5:
What are the three most dominant colors in this image, and where do they appear?

ANSWER:
The three most dominant colors in this image are:

1. **Light Gray**: This color appears on the wooden planks that make up the door, covering most of the surface. The light gray tone is consistent across the majority of the door, with some variations in shading due to wear and tear.

2. **Dark Gray/Black**: This darker shade is visible in several areas, including:
   - The circular hole on the left side of the image.
   - Some of the bolts and screws holding the door together.
   - Minor spots and streaks scattered across the door's surface, likely due to wear or rust.

3. **White**: While not as dominant as the light gray, white is noticeable in certain areas where the paint may have chipped off or where there are highlights on the metal parts. However, its presence is more subtle compared to the other two colors.
