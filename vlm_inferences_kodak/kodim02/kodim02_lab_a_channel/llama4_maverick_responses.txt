QUESTION Q5:
What are the three most dominant colors in this image, and where do they appear?

ANSWER:
The image is a grayscale photograph, so it does not contain any colors. The dominant shades are various tones of gray, which appear throughout the image. The lightest shades of gray are visible on the door and the surrounding wall, while the darkest shades are seen in the shadows and on the metal objects attached to the door. 

Since the image is grayscale, there are no three dominant colors to identify. However, if we were to analyze the shades present, we could say that the lightest gray dominates the majority of the image, followed by a mid-tone gray, and then the darkest gray. These shades are distributed across the entire image, with the lightest gray being the most prevalent.
