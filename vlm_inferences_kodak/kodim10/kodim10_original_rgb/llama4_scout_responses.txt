QUESTION Q5:
What are the three most dominant colors in this image, and where do they appear?

ANSWER:
The three most dominant colors in this image are:

1. **White**: The sails of the boats are predominantly white, with some having blue and green numbers on them. The white color appears on the sails, which take up a significant portion of the image.
2. **Blue**: The blue color appears in several places, including the numbers on the sail (in "eca22 63455"), the sky in the background, and the jacket worn by one of the people on the boat.
3. **Gray**: The gray color appears in the water, which takes up a significant portion of the bottom half of the image, and also in the sky, which is a lighter shade of blue-gray.

These colors are dominant because they appear in large areas of the image and catch the viewer's attention.
