QUESTION Q4:
How would you describe the color quality and lighting in this image?

ANSWER:
The image is presented in black and white, which affects the color quality by eliminating any potential color distractions and focusing attention on the textures, tones, and contrasts within the scene.

This type of lighting helps to create a sense of depth and dimensionality in the image.

The overall effect of the lighting is to highlight the features of the two birds, particularly their beaks, eyes, and feathers. The use of black and white also allows for a greater range of tonal values, which adds to the overall visual interest and drama of the image.
