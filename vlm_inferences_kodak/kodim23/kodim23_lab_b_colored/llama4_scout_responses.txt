QUESTION Q5:
What are the three most dominant colors in this image, and where do they appear?

ANSWER:
The three most dominant colors in this image are:

1. **Yellow**: The yellow tone is the most prominent and appears throughout the entire image, covering the birds and the background.
2. **Gray/Purple**: A grayish-purple hue is visible as a secondary dominant color, overlaying the yellow tone to create a unique effect. It appears on the birds' bodies, beaks, and feathers, as well as in the background.

There is no third dominant color present in the image, as the yellow and gray/purple tones are the primary colors used. The white space on the right side of the image serves as a border rather than a dominant color within the image itself.
