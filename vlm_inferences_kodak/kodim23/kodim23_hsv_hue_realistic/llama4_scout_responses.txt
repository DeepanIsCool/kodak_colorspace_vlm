QUESTION Q5:
What are the three most dominant colors in this image, and where do they appear?

ANSWER:
The three most dominant colors in this image are:

1. **Green**: The green color appears on the top of the blue and yellow macaw's head, as well as in the blurred background, where several green leaves are visible.
2. **Red**: The red color is prominent on the head and body of the red macaw, which is positioned on the right side of the image.
3. **Blue/Yellow**: The blue and yellow macaw, located on the left side of the image, displays a vibrant combination of blue and yellow hues on its body. The blue color appears on its wings, while the yellow color covers its chest and belly. These two colors are equally dominant and could be considered as one combined answer; however, if I had to pick one, I would say **Blue** is slightly more dominant due to its presence on the wings. 

However, if I had to pick only three colors, I would say the three most dominant colors are **Red**, **Blue**, and **Green**.
