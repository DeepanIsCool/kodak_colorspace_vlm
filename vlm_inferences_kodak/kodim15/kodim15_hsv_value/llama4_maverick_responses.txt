QUESTION Q5:
What are the three most dominant colors in this image, and where do they appear?

ANSWER:
The image is a black-and-white photograph, so it does not have any colors. The dominant shades are various tones of gray, white, and black.

However, if we were to imagine the colors that might be present in a colored version of this image, the three most dominant colors could be:

1. **Skin tone**: The child's skin tone is likely to be a medium to dark brown color, which would be the most dominant color in the image.
2. **White paint**: The white paint on the child's face is another dominant color, used to create a design around her eye.
3. **Gray or beige sweater**: The child's sweater appears to be a light gray or beige color, which is also a dominant color in the image.

These colors would be present in the child's skin, the paint on her face, and her clothing.
