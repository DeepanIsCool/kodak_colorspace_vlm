QUESTION Q4:
How would you describe the color quality and lighting in this image?

ANSWER:
The image is a black-and-white photograph of a young child with face paint. The color quality is grayscale, with no visible colors present.

The lighting in the image appears to be artificial and somewhat harsh, as evidenced by the strong shadows on the left side of the child's face and the bright highlights on the right side. The overall effect is one of high contrast, which adds to the dramatic appearance of the child's face paint. The lighting also creates a sense of depth and dimensionality in the image, drawing the viewer's attention to the child's features. 

However, the image has been heavily edited or filtered, resulting in an unnatural look with noticeable artifacts and texture.

QUESTION Q5:
What are the three most dominant colors in this image, and where do they appear?

ANSWER:
The three most dominant colors in this image are:

1. **White**: The white color is prominent on the child's face, particularly on the forehead, nose, and chin. It appears as a result of the reflective light on the child's skin, creating highlights. Additionally, the child's clothing or shawl is also white.

2. **Black**: The black color is dominant in the background of the image, which is a dark gray or black color that provides contrast to the child's face. It also appears on the child's face as part of the face paint.

3. **Gray**: The gray color is the most dominant color in the image, as it is the primary tone of the child's skin and the background. The gray tone is present throughout the image, with various shades ranging from light to dark.
